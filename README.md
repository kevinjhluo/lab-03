## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1: 
RESTful APIs are scalable because REST optimizes client-server interactions. Their statelessness also allow them to not store the client request information. Their cacheability also reduces the stress on the server.

Answer for Question 2:
The resources that the email server gives to client include the mail, mail id, inbox, sent emails, and status on whether an email is successfully deleted or not.

Answer for Question 3:
PUT was a method that wasn't used in our server. If we were to include an edit exisitng mails feature, we could implement PUT to update any changes we have made.

Answer for Question 4:
API keys allow the server to authenticate whether the client holds an authorization (https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/when-why-api-key#:~:text=API%20keys%20provide%20project%20authorization,-To%20decide%20which&text=By%20identifying%20the%20calling%20project,or%20enabled%20in%20the%20API.)
